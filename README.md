# divingApp
Flutter app for course project. 

App idea is to be dive logger. 

User adds diving entries and frontpage shows statistics for dives. 

User can add new dive Tank from settings page. 

When window is narrow user has frontpage, divings page and settings. 
If page is wider frontpage has divings on same page as statistics. Settings are on own page. 

App adds mock data for demo.
